# Reading MySql data through NodeJS - A Tutorial

In this tutorial, we’ll have a look at getting started with the mysql module — a Node.js driver for MySQL, written in JavaScript. We make use of this module to connect to a MySQL database, and perform the usual CRUD operations. This tutorial only shows how to establish a working connection between the MySQL database and Node.


Here’s how to use MySQL in Node in 5 easy steps:

1. Create a new project: mkdir mysql-test && cd mysql-test
2. Create a package.json file: npm init –y
3. Install the mysql module: npm install mysql –save
4. Create an script.js file and copy in the snippet in the script.js file.
5. Run the file: node script.js. Observe a “Connected!” message.
